LiveLink : https://seckin-news.vercel.app/

Libraries and Technologies I use :

React, SASS, Material UI,  Axios, Router, Redux Tool Kit , News API ,


** newsapi.org, since May 2020 they changed the liberties of the free developer keys, 
and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost. **

*** In localhost it was all working fine, 
but then after deploying the site to Vercel,
got a “Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 426 (Upgrade Required)” error.***
